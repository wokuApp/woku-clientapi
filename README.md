## Branching and Deployment Strategy

1. **Develop Branch**:
   Default development branch. Dockerized and hosted on Azure Container Registry and deployed on Azure App Service. Access the API in development at [https://woku-clientapi-dev.azurewebsites.net](https://woku-clientapi-dev.azurewebsites.net).

2. **Main Branch**:
   Similar DevOps as develop. Production API available at [https://clientapi.woku.app](https://clientapi.woku.app).

## Documentation

The `woku-clientapi` is documented using Swagger in NestJS. This documentation covers the various endpoints, expected request/response structures. For more thorough and comprehensive documentation, review [API.md](API.md).

You can access the documentation for each environment as follows:

- **Development Environment**: For the development version of the API, access the documentation at [https://woku-clientapi-dev.azurewebsites.net/documentation](https://woku-clientapi-dev.azurewebsites.net/documentation). Ideal for working on or testing new features.

- **Local Environment**: When running the server locally, the documentation is available at [http://localhost:3000/documentation](http://localhost:3000/documentation). Useful for developers referring to the documentation while working on the local version of the API.

- **Production Environment**: For the main production version, the documentation can be found at [https://clientapi.woku.app/documentation](https://clientapi.woku.app/documentation). This is the definitive reference for users and developers interacting with the stable production version of the API.

The Swagger documentation provides a user-friendly interface, allowing for easy exploration, testing, and interaction with the API endpoints directly through the browser.

Note: A GET request to any main link should return "woku client api ‚≠êÔ∏èüí¨". For local development, set up a .env file in the root of the project with the variable PORT=3000 and specify in the API variable the access to the main woku server in development or production.
